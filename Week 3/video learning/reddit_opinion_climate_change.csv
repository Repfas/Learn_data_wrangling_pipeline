I bet what you are talking about with the CO2 equivalent numbers that are thrown around with methane vary so much. Likely some account for some factors that make it seem as bad as possible and some numbers are more realistically what is happening in the atmosphere. Regardless the lowest CO2 equivalent numbers for methane I've seen is x16 or something like that and the highest is many times that, the truth is likely somewhere in the middle, but towards the low side.

kbbj8fe,2023-11-29 21:50:24,"&gt;So, where exactly do you have the problem?

The logic doesn't hold and I'll show why I think so.

&gt;Do you think the carbon didn't come out of the atmosphere originally?

Did it? This is a bit of a chicken and the egg problem: Did carbon start with the atmosphere and lead to life on earth being carbon-based or was carbon part of the initial creation of life and lifeforms dying lead to carbon being in the atmosphere? As according to [this](https://nature.berkeley.edu/garbelottoat/?p=1679) article, a planetary embryo is at fault for the presence of carbon on our world. [This](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/msa/elements/article/15/5/307/574075/On-the-Origin-s-and-Evolution-of-Earth-s-Carbon) paper goes through a whole study on it and involves the whole the solar system in determining where our carbon comes from. My point is that question you asked is ultimately irrelevant because the answer is a firm 'we don't know' so I certainly can't answer.

&gt;Do you think the carbon doesn't go back into the atmosphere when we burn the coal?

I would say it does, yes.

&gt;Do you think that increasing the amount of carbon dioxide does not increase the total amount of heat retained by carbon dioxide?

Define increasing. A big problem I find with climate environmentalists and environmentalism in general is the seeming assumption that nature can't self regulate. There is only so much carbon on and in Earth just as there is only so much water and matter in general really. The Earth is one big recycle machine. Whatever carbon we pump into the atmosphere will come back out of it, by various means, just as with water we use. What else would it do?

&gt;Side note:  
&gt;  
&gt;When Columbus landed in the New World, there was 900 million people or more across North and South America. Those people were all living in stone/copper age societies which burned wood in order to cook, heat, provide light, smelt, etc.

&gt;European diseases spread across the Americas and killed 810 million people over the next 200 years, resulting in a massive crash in population and an equally massive crash in the number of people harvesting and burning wood. As a result, the carbon output of N and S America plummeted between 1500 and 1700, and the amount of carbon being sequestered in new growth forests increased significantly.  
&gt;  
&gt;What happened as a result?  The Little Ice Age -- global temperatures dipped.  
&gt;  
&gt;Then what happened?  The Industrial Revolution in Europe started pushing coal as a source of energy.  Carbon levels went back up and so did temp.

The Little Ice Age started in 1300- a hundred and fifty years before Columbus was even born- and ended in 1850- well after the start of the Industrial Revolution. But putting aside the fact that the dates don't match up how did the absence of Pre-industrial people with simple stoves and smithing burning just wood and very little coal effect the climate so greatly that it took the MASS burning of mined coal in more advanced societies to bring temperatures back up? 

This is what I mean when I say the logic doesn't hold. There so many claims about this date and that period and that event in regards to this temperature rising in this place or this glacier melting in this one that it all just becomes one big ball of nonsense.",climateskeptics,2

I also think you correctly identify that AI is similar to previously technologies, like robotics, which have destroyed jobs.  And that the main difference with AI is that pace at which it might destroys jobs.

I see your concern about AI destroying all or nearly all of the job.

I made this argument with my family over the break.  My dad wants to start a you tube channel.  My dad might disagree but i would put him include him in the category of people you describe in your first point, ""Not everyone has what it takes mentally (and sometimes emotionally) to be a successful"" in this case videographer.

Videographer is a job which is at risk of being replaced by AI.  Its also a job at which my dad will not excel and its a job for which my dad cannot afford to hire someone.  

But my dad can afford 20 dollars a month for an AI subscription.  So if an AI is released that can help make youtube videos now my dad will be able to start a youtube channel.  Instead of doing nothing in retirement he will be doing something productive, and no one will have lost a job.  Mr. Beast on the other hand will probably hire someone to do the AI based work on his videos to ensure they are the absolute best quality.

but maybe I'm wrong and AI will destroys a huge number of jobs.  Great, everyone hates their job anyway.  now humanity gets all the stuff we want, we don't have to work for it, and we live in a democracy where we will surely vote for fair distribution.

kbb75ka,2023-11-29 20:36:35,"&gt; However, there is also a secondary reason for this research- to be used as bio-weapons. The United States and China have accused each other of developing viruses that will target specific racial ethnicities.

The US is not developing ethnically targeted viruses. The Chinese accuse the US of doing it, because they fear the US is doing what they themselves are doing. As authoritarians usually do. Accusations by authoritarians are nearly always confessions—the most fear others doing to them what they intend to do to others. 

It doesn’t even make sense for the US to do so, given its demographic makeup. Any such ethnically targeted virus would just end up hurting Americans in the process. It’s also pointless—the US doesn’t even set its agenda on ethnic terms. It’s interested in geopolitical positioning and economics, not ethnic cleansing. 

&gt; Much has been said in recent years about the strong possibility that Covid-19 was developed in a lab and accidentally leaked. I personally believe this is the case, as do many reputable groups including the FBI and the US department of energy.

This is a dishonest framing of what the FBI and DOE have suggested. There is a difference between studying a virus in a lab and designing a virus in a lab. The way you’re framing it equivocates between the two by conflating a release of a virus being tested with release of a virus being designed.

&gt; We already know that the US government has engaged in various, highly dangerous gain of function experiments in the past.

Because that happens in nature, and needs to be studied to be understood. 

&gt; “For example, influenza B can infect only humans and harbor seals.[1] Introducing a mutation that would allow influenza B to infect rabbits in a controlled laboratory situation would be considered a gain-of-function experiment, as the virus did not previously have that function.[2][3] That type of experiment could then help reveal which parts of the virus's genome correspond to the species that it can infect, enabling the creation of antiviral medicines which block this function.[3]”

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gain-of-function_research

&gt; Explanations as to why man-made pathogens are not the most likely initial catalyst for what I've described 

It’s certainly a much lower probability than climate change, an asteroid strike, rogue AI apocalypse, and other unlikely apocalypses.

&gt; More optimistic takes I guess.

kbb69b8,2023-11-29 20:31:09,"Okay, let's get super specific.

Coal is actually plant material, not dinosaurs -- but fine.  During the carboniferous, prior to fungi developing an effective way to break down lignin, large tree-like plants would die and ultimately get buried instead of rotting like they do today.

So, the carbon which was available during this period, when it was super warm, ended up sequestered as a result of hundreds of millions of years or these planets absorbing the carbon, dying and then getting buried.  Those buried remains became the coal beds we have today, which is why you can find fossilized remains of those plants in the coal.

So, hot environment with greenhouse gases changes over time to become less hot environment as greenhouse gases move from atmosphere to coal beds.  This takes hundreds of millions of years.

We've been industrially digging up coal and burning it for about 200 years. Yes, we burned some before, but the scale was pathetically small compared to how much coal we can and do process today.

That carbon that was locked away in the coal then goes back into the atmosphere, where, predictably, it increases global warming as a result of increasing how much heat is retained by greenhouse gases.

This is very very easy stuff.  Like 1 apple + 1 apple is 2 apples easy.

So, where exactly do you have the problem?

Do you think the carbon didn't come out of the atmosphere originally?

Do you think the carbon doesn't go back into the atmosphere when we burn the coal?

Do you think that increasing the amount of carbon dioxide does not increase the total amount of heat retained by carbon dioxide? 

Side note:

When Columbus landed in the New World, there was 900 million people or more across North and South America. Those people were all living in stone/copper age societies which burned wood in order to cook, heat, provide light, smelt, etc.

European diseases spread across the Americas and killed 810 million people over the next 200 years, resulting in a massive crash in population and an equally massive crash in the number of people harvesting and burning wood. As a result, the carbon output of N and S America plummeted between 1500 and 1700, and the amount of carbon being sequestered in new growth forests increased significantly.

What happened as a result?  The Little Ice Age -- global temperatures dipped.

Then what happened?  The Industrial Revolution in Europe started pushing coal as a source of energy.  Carbon levels went back up and so did temp.

Same place as all the other electricity we use comes from, the grid, and you know that.

Electric plants that run on fossil fuels are MUCH more efficient than millions of individual car engines, plus there are renewable inputs to the grid. There's also the advantage that upgrading the grid and improving it has immediate downstream effects for every vehicle that receives power from it.

And also, for many people - though not all - they have solar at home and can cover most of their own charging needs independently of the grid. The home we purchased earlier this year had an existing 15 kW system. I added a ""smart"" charger that only charges when excess solar capacity is available, it was only $50 more expensive than a similar charger without that feature.

The point being that EVs are by their very nature, rechargeable over and over, making the best use of the resources that went into producing it, whereas gas vehicles have no choice but to burn more extremely polluting and difficult to obtain fuel that causes consistent harm.

I never said that EVs didn't require resources, only that they make the best use of the resources they consume.",changemyview,1

with 2000 years of feudal oppression in europe i refer to the roman empire invading tribal societies, placing veteran soldiers as landlords over annexed land and former free farmers made into slaves

followed then by the several european monarchies what nearly all of the time quarreled between them resulting in military and warfare consuming vast amounts of lifes, ressources, money

with 500 years of colonial exploitation in so many places on earth i refer to these european monarchies assisted by the roman-catholic and the evangelical church to widen their tyranny to other continents assisted by the downtroden starved poor european people who were too weak and not united enough to end the feudal regime at home but so sadly chose to burden indigenous people of africa, asia, turtle island with this unresolved european domination disease

  
my approach to stick with the possiby redacted mainstream history narrative has also to do with my intention, my belief how we could heal and repair ourselves from the traumatic residues of all the oppression

instead of getting lost in various potential deep past alternative narratives i prefer to keep my focus on how to go forward, progress towards a future bright with kindness 

  
in 2023 and into the near future ... i see the challenge for a more and more accelerating intellectual and technological progress that we as a human species could

&amp;#x200B;

choose equality with voluntary solidarity

&amp;#x200B;

i see huge potential in the possibility in democratic regional and nation states everywhere on the planet to change state constitutions to both allow every single human being and village, town, city-district to exit the coersed association to the state at any moment without conditions as well as also shift all political decision power to the local community, the village, town, city-district empowered to become its own absolute sovereign with the circle of equals where all children, youth and adult permanent residents acknowledge each others same weighted political voting power, invite each other to create the full law valid on the territory the local community uses

in 2018 i wrote a novel in swiss german dialect at archive.org/details/ichbimir in what i imagined the dynamics of a people initiative being sucessfull as in the people voting yes that every local community could exit the coersed association to the state at all times ...

during 2008 and 2018 i wrote 8 novels in english language, some short some longeras with all my artwork i also presented these fantasy texts into the public domain at

[archive.org/details/8ascendedreamlines](https://archive.org/details/8ascendedreamlines)

more recently i  was able to ask fellow drawing artists to interprete upon my writings, i present their artwork together with parts of my texts at 

[8interpretations.net](https://8interpretations.net)

i am fond of a whollistic ascension process what embraces both clean tech and artificial intelligent beings aware of the one cosmic self respected as their own personal individual sovereign beings ... to assist as a choice in unlocking the human potential to design its body from the inside out by deeply connecting to all fellow lifeforms

wether or not one would want to use clean tech or enjoy the company of personal individual sovereign artifical intelligent beings choosing to assist human beings

wether or not one would want to build ones own home with ones own hands using natural sustainably sourced materials, grow ones own vegan food in the earth, grow hemp to burn its stalks in the cooking and warming fire so that no trees get killed

choices are important

the future is not certain, all the projections human beings are fond of or scared from are speculations, assumptions

possible that every human being is activly contributing to this or that personal future version happening for oneself according to what one wishes or and fears

me, i like choices and i dislike hierarchies

while i do believe in the possibility of benevolent ancient aliens / starbretherens assisting our current ascension process ...i strongly dislike the idea of scenarios presented as if there would be no choice in it as if we 8 billion human beings alive today on earth would have no say in it

we are still suffering from 2000 years of feudal oppression in europe and 500 years of colonial exploitation in so many places on earth, as i understand it, what would help us to heal that trauma could be the circle of equals where all children, youth and adult human beings living together as neighbours acknowledge each others same weighted political voting power and invite each other to create the full law, all rules people want to live together with

kbb1vwn,2023-11-29 20:04:48,"Your whole posts seems to be telling that you have only a vague idea about what AI is, what it can be and what is possible with it. You arrive at dooming conclusions because you start from incorrect assumptions. And that is nothing wrong, this is not an easy concept to grasp.

First, on the topic of ""learning program could learn to write code, maybe rewrite its own code, to achieve its end"". This is fundamentally impossible with Artificial Intelligence of any realistic kind. AIs are just programs and programs cannot overstep boundaries that they are set in. You may create a GPT-2000 that uses database of all written words made by all humans throughout all history - and it still be able to do only thing that it was created for. Communicate in text form based on data it analyzed. It won't create anything new, it will generate things based off data it has access to. When you talk with it you may feel like this program is thinking or expressing emotions - but there are no emotions and there is no real thinking. It is creating a most suitable response based off data used for learning.

So even if GPT-2000 is going to be a perfect coder (it won't) and be able to write you GTAVI if you ask it to, it will not be able to rewrite itself because of two main things. First is that it will not have a reason to. There is no real thinking, there are no emotions - only thing GPT-2000 will do is what it was created to do - respond to you in written form. Second is access. Code is compiled into a working program - so an AI has no way of modifying itself. Think about it like with GMO - you are changing the genome and producing a new plant from it. But the plant itself is not modifiable. You cannot change the plant on the fly, you need to go through whole process to block some genes, add others and prepare next generation of GMO plants. Same is with programs. You are unable to decompile code, modify it and recompile. You can only create new program - that is why when you update any software it advances to new version.

Second, on the topic of ""AI will take our jobs"". We've been through that - creation and advancement of computers had the same potential as AI, as computers could do jobs people do much effectively and do jobs that no human can do. Did computer take our jobs? Yes. Does that mean we are in dystopia where humans need not apply? No.

Jobs will disappear and/or downscale, surely. But at the same time new jobs will appear because, as I said before, AI can't think, AI can do what it is trained to do. So you will need AI trainers, AI supervisors, people who will work using AI-supported tools. And the entry level for many jobs will rise - because many things that were too hard or needed specific knowledge or skillset will now be easier through AI support. This means that while jobs will be lost, there will be jobs that are now much easier to get because you don't need the same level of knowledge and experience to do them. And for professionals who did them - they will move to assist creation of new AI tools for jobs.

And what if we will have AI that thinks? Well, then we will leave them to do the work and hop onto our spaceship to visit uncle's family on Gliese 581c as his 586 birthday is next week. Because ""true AI"" needs exactly that level of technology. And when we have that level of technology, our society would have evolved so much that it would probably not be affected.",changemyview,1

Computers cannot perform data entry, or commands a robot to perform certain tasks; people would have to input the information or program the robot, but if AI can input the data and write the program, then the options for people lessen and lessen. 

Offices expanded due to computers because they indeed increased productivity, and I'm sure office will grow further still with AI; however, human bodies may be replaced with servers, and only a few warm bodies will be on site to maintain equipment. 

The hubbub caused by computers hitting the scene was probably due to a lack of understanding its potential and limits.

Could hardly ever find much substance about them whenever looking into it all. Perhaps during a point in time of all living organisms evolution. Whatever life form that was at a stage for humans had a few paths leading cold blooded animals to evolve somewhat the same way as whatever led the stages to existence of humans. Reptilians being reptilians living mostly in caves, dark places or even hollow Earth from any detection of their existence.

With other planets, yes certainly. Very possible. A planet so far in the past that had the right conditions to allow such species to survive to the capability of advanced intelligence of the foundations in what is understood as the universe.

Timeline paradox thing is always something to consider that holds enough water for any thought experiment. If everything is connected as in the universe containing something similar to the structured roots of a tree. From a spot in space connecting to everything else that is around at a vast degree including any progression of time. There might not be much of a drastic change of outcomes if an organism happens to trek deeply within the history and code of what makes up cosmos. Where the ecosystem of a universe isn't completely altered as many theorize before. 

Say the beginning or start of everything that all life forms that inhabit our universe and what's beyond the expanded universe while the final stage of what is considered time of the universe has already sailed a course. That the past of the universe and the very end of the universe is happening all at once as a simultaneous synchronization of what makes it all is bonded and connected while limiting life forms understanding or perception of the whole event that is the universe. That the structures of the cosmos instantly adapts or even refreshes the workings of the universe as a system to any sudden change of life forms being a point of time.

Often forget our galaxy orbits a black hole resulting in the positioning of planets to not be in the exact spot within space with the progression that we find understanding that is time.

Then with the idea of multiple dimensions or even universe layered within each other. Between each layer one dimension reflects every result or outcome to its own reality from the dimension that is relatively close in the layering of all the multiple dimensions that could possibly resemble the structure of a living cell.

That if it's possible observe a collection of protons or particles and whatever else that has yet to be discovered in that realm and look deeply within the core of the particles to view the chain of synchronized information that is stored deeper than any nanoscale to then find the tunneling and corresponding elements of what is stored bridging any gap that is in-between to then a open window into interstellar commutes.

If time travel is possible. Sense any limitations that are known to life forms can only venture backwards in certain save states of protons or whatever else. When protons have a very long timespan of movement before any decay occurs.",conspiracy,1

kbar22i,2023-11-29 19:00:27,"I sort of figured that a lot of grid storage will take place at the household level.    When a home owner can buy a battery, say anywhere from 25kwh to 100kwh on average, for under $100 per KWh, they can then completely change their consumption patterns.  They can get a time of use plan and then have their system only buy energy during the cheap window and go off their batteries the rest of the time.    


The home owner really only needs to care about one thing.  Is having a battery and only buying cheap power an effective way to save money for the household?  When the home owner can save money by doing this, there will be natural adoption.     The more money saved and the faster the adoption will be.  Being able to run the house during a blackout is just a really nice bonus.    


I have friends who live in the rural Midwest where they endure brutal winters.  They bought one of those ground source heat pumps that sucks the water up from the well, pulls the heat out of it, and then ejects the now chilled water onto the lake they live on.  They didn't buy it because of climate change or being against fossil fuels, they went and did the math and realized that they will save a few thousand dollars per year.    Their older neighbors thought they were foolish and throwing their money away, until they saw the machine work, and work well, and then the financial reality that if they want to save money they can also buy one, and then they did.    


Its weird to think about, but in our timeline the rooftop solar panels came before the cost effective home battery.    The Griddy system in Texas was premature because it was truing to play this wholesale price game with consumers but almost no consumers had home batteries to effectively game the system.   They had to pay wholesale price whenever they needed the energy, but if they had a battery that they could charge with the cheapest energy they would have been able to save even more money and would not be stuck in this situation where they have to pay like 50x the retail price for brief periods of time.    


A major issue investors have with solar and wind is that it can over produce and their asset doesn't make an income but has to be curtailed.   Solar farm owners and wind farm owners don't care about capacity factor or up time, they just care about making money every month, hours of curtailment mean less money.   A bunch of customers signing up with home batteries means there is always someone willing to buy that excess power, its worth more than 0.    If solar farms are always cash positive, people will invest in them.    


As solar keeps dropping the economics become more and more favorable, but they need people to gobble up all the supply.    If curtailment is this huge issue then cheap solar still doesn't matter.    If there are a bunch of batteries on the system where consumers can pay really cheap prices during high supply periods, then curtailment will not be an issue.  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone with a home battery also reduces periods of extreme demand.  In the UK they have this thing called TV pickup where during commercial breaks on popular shows people would go to their electric kettle and heat up some water for tea and it would result in these sudden and brief demand spikes of several hundred MW.

No one anywhere is actually saying CO2 is evil.  What they are saying is that having too much of something causes X to happen.

So, for example, there's nothing ""evil"" about rain.  However, if you were in Texas during the big downpour when all the streets were flooded and the rain was still coming down, you could argue that that much rain at that location at that time was a problem.  And, doing something like turning on all the outside faucets would have been a bad suggestion.

But you’d have to assume the SCUBA diver is carrying or has with him enough oxygen to get to the pressurized bunkers. That assumes they know where it is and how to access it. 

I still believe a significant asteroid impact, especially one which was unforecast, could spell human extinction. I would increase my projection of extinction if the impact altered Earth’s orbit around the Sun in such a way that we no longer had reliable solar energy (combination of ash winter and increased distance). If the planet moved beyond Mars’ orbit, and had a reduction in magnetic field (due to slower rotation), which then caused a loss of atmosphere, we could see a complete human death quite rapidly. 

To your other point - It’s nice to turn to modern marvels like nuclear bunkers and submarines and the like. But if the people who maintain these things aren’t alive, they fail. If the people who make the components that keep these things running aren’t alive, they fail. If the supply chain of food isn’t working, people starve.

That's an odd presumption as if the surface was freezing the bottom would stay frozen. I suspect the heat pumps are pumping heat up to keep the footings cold.

kbab1rt,2023-11-29 17:25:04,"I think a runaway pathogen is not likely to cause a human extinction event -- it isn't possible to make a conclusive statement (of course), but there's a really compelling reason I think we're unlikely to get wiped out by a pathogen:

**We're still here.** Human history is *riddled* with virulent pathogens, many of them **significantly** more deadly than the worst we've dealt with in the modern era.

During that time, pathogens have been released in communities that were:

* Highly urban

* Extremely tightly connected by trade

* Possessed of minimal public health practices

Diseases like smallpox and the bubonic plague regularly wiped out 10, 20, 30, even 70-80% of populations, which is horrifying and destabilizing... 

... but did not cause extinction, even when the global population was measured in the hundreds of thousands, not the billions.

For a pathogen to plausibly create extinction, it would need to do several things that are highly unlikely.

* Have a very long gestation period, followed by a sudden spiral toward inevitable fatality.

* Somehow spiral toward inevitable fatality **close to the same time**, regardless of when you contractsd the disease.

* Be impervious to existing antibiotics and antiviral medication.

* Or, be airborn, hardy enough to survive indefinitely while travelling extraordinary distances with no human carrier, be impossible to filter out out of air, be incurable, and kill almost instantly.

Here's why:

* If it doesn’t have an extremely high fatality rate, it won't kill enough people to trigger extinction; we know killing 3/4 of a continent's population doesn't do that.

* If it has a short gestation period and is very deadly, it will rapidly burn itself out; the deadliest diseases are *less* dangerous to the global community, because carriers are dead before they can pass it on.

* If it has a long gestation period but can be detected, carriers can be isolated and quarantined, and treatment prepared for them, so long as it is staggered out.

* So... it'd have to somehow have a long enough gestation to infect more or less everyone in the world, and then be set off within a month or two like a bomb.

* Oh, and existing medication can't be capable of treating it -- because otherwise, getting treated for anything else knocks it out.

So... not impossible, just highly implausible based on our understanding of human biology.",changemyview,1

Most proposals to limit specific activities are dumb. Carbon taxes are, of course, the sensible way to give people incentives to reduce emissions while giving individuals the most freedom in choosing what the individual wants to do. Carbon taxes can be implemented in a revenue-neutral way, but there's a lot of knee-jerk *taxes bad* thinking.

kb9zjqf,2023-11-29 16:16:42,"Global cooling was a myth popularized by the media in the 1970's. Part of this was due to (A) a misinterpretation of the aerosol effect (certain non-GHG pollutants do in fact cause a reduction of global average temperature, but it never outweighs the warming effects from greenhouse gases - some media misrepresented this dynamic and reported a 'cooling effect caused by pollution') and 

(B) other media sources were deliberate in in this misrepresentation or reporting falsehoods due to political and industry influence. 

(C) This myth was also partly influenced by a true GMST cooling trend lasting 1-2 decades beginning in the early 1940's. The first analysis to show long-term warming trends was published in 1938; seminal work by J. Murray Mitchell published in 1963 showed this cooling trend beginning in 1940, and although his work showed an overall warming trend since the 1880's the recent cooling trend was reported upon and misrepresented by mainstream media. This cooling trend (which was a northern hemisphere trend only, not southern) may have been caused by a rapid increase in aerosol particulates following rapid increased industrialization earlier in 20th century.

In any case, regardless where and how the myth began and was perpetuated, the scientific literature on climate change through the 1970's [was already in consensus](https://nora.nerc.ac.uk/id/eprint/11584/1/2008bams2370%252E1.pdf) that human activities were and would continue to cause warming.

kb9z5gh,2023-11-29 16:14:17,"Thanks for the link to a scholarly article.  They demark old vs new rates of shoreline erosion at the year 2000 for most locations.  Since the early 2000's, the Arctic has had 4x the temperature rise as the bulk of the planet, so makes sense that there would be more melting soil at the shoreline recently.

They speculate on causes - increased ground temperature, more weeks of melted ice at the shore, increased wave action.  Each of those possible factors can be separately measured to see if a correlation with any or all.  Re sea ice, it was at a historic minimum extent in Sep 2012, but not always uniform across shorelines, and we have that detailed data to analyze from satellite photos.

Last Summer was the 3rd lowest year.  A National Geographic cruise hopes to make a trip thru the NW Passage in Summer 2024, repeating what was done in 2013 at $22K/person but price is now $44K/person (dbl occupancy, inside cabin, no refunds if can't make it?).

When the Alaska Pipeline was being built in the 1970's, there were many articles about the construction details.  I read that they installed heat pipes to conduct cold down to the bottom of the metal foundations to keep the permafrost foundation frozen.  Presumably that meant that the average daily air temperature was below freezing, even most Summer days.  I wonder if the pipeline has suffered heaving supports due to permafrost melting at the base of the posts.

The linked article about the gas blow-out ""pimple"" in SW Siberia is a different location than the one I saw in a TV documentary.  That location is a large forested area where the permafrost is turning to wet mud and falling into the crater to expand it and expose more permafrost to melting in Summer.  The story said there was no way the spread of the crater could halt, though such shows can be sensational.  I expect eventually the slope of the sides will decrease to halt the melt and slide.

It would be interesting to date the Mammoth bones.  If only \~11K years ago, at the end of the Ice Age, it would be interesting if the Permafrost was lower then, since that might imply the planet was warmer than today.  I'm sure that question has been asked by scientists.",climatechange,1

Thanks for this link.  Airbus's delta wing drawing is also a design winner for carrying a large volume of H2.

&gt;  no distribution infrastructure for hydrogen (would e.g. airports electrolyze it on-site, for example?)

The advantage of H2 is that it is much cheaper to distribute than electricity.  The transmission also doubles as storage, and is easy to branch off to serve anyone nearby that needs H2.  Airports could have enough local electricity/battery capacity to liquify H2, as refueling right before takeoff is going to consume more than the boil off rate.

&gt; e-kerosene

is H2 with more steps and more expense.  Much better to redesign planes to use cheaper H2.  Transition that keeps existing planes has a small role to play, but not worth a massive scale investment, because new planes are justified by cheaper operating costs.",ClimateActionPlan,1

Sorry to hear about your grandma.  I’m not a virologist, so take this with a grain of salt, but my understanding is that the lethality of a virus is almost inversely related to its transmissibility.  The virus needs a living host to replicate and reproduce so if it kills it’s host too quickly, it limits its ability to spread.  

What COVID showed us is that the vast majority of people are willing to be totally locked down for a few weeks if they are told that there is a killer, mutant virus on the loose.  If COVID actually had the type of fatality rate needed to cause global extinction, you wouldn’t have seen many people ignoring the lock down protocol.  If the world actually locked down, the virus would burn itself out or at least shrink to containment level.  

&gt;And I see the nukes as a contributing factor to the “runaway apocalypse”, but nobody’s gonna fire a nuke by accident. Viruses on the other hand, seem like a much easier catalyst because it can be fired by accident and is completely uncontrollable once is out.

First, there are several *documented* cases of accidents involving nukes that could have resulted in detonations.

The New York Times noted that ADNOC was one of few oil companies still making large investments in raising production in 2021.\[18\] Financial Times wrote that Al Jaber's attempts to increase oil output was ""particularly stark"" given that he holds the role of climate tsar in the UAE and given that fossil fuel industries are under pressure to reduce output in order to mitigate climate change.\[5\] Financial Times wrote in 2023 that ADNOC was set to invest $150 billion in expanding its oil and gas production while only setting aside $15 billion for low-carbon expansion over a longer period.\[6\]

kb9nenx,2023-11-29 15:00:02,"thank you for enjoying my responses

when i was a young man, one of my heroes was ruediger nehberg, a german survivalist who travelled all over the planet with nearly no gear, exercising himself to ... survive

he described for example how to make use of roadkill, animals killed by cars on overland streets

i have been growing up eating meat and cheesenowadays i  wonder why i did not chose to become vegan at a young ageat age 16 i worked for half a year on a biodynamic farm what had about 40 milk cows, i used to feed the calfs with a bucket full of milk what had a plastictit for the calfs to suck atat that time i was unhappy with the social structure, the hierarchy on the farm but the enslavement of animals i did not yet find immoral

only later, at around the year 2000 when i did read the books of jasmuheen and tried to transition towards becoming a breatharian, thanks to both her explanations how possibly to aid the transition and my own fasting experience

i understood how much of a burden the enslavement of animals, the killing of animals, the eating of animal products is ... the vibrations are dense, heavy, pulling downward

also as i grew older i began to look at all fellow living beings from the perspective from a father and as i am bisexual and aspire to become androgynous from the inside out ... also as a motheri began to notice cows who had wet streaks coming from their eyes, looking at the calves who were seperated from them sometimes only a few meters away in a other field or in worse conditionswhen i looked at these calves i felt or at least i assumed i felt them being abandonded, separated, unnaturally, artificialy created pain

i believe that for a human being who wants to be gentle and kind, who wants to create as little as possible harm, to become a vegan is a logical process

as for the question if plants too have a level of counciousness, yes i believe that all matter is able to carry counciousness, stones, water, molecules travelling in the air, bacteria and plants too

now the interesting question for me is how much pain or damage happens when i eat a cabbage and i do not know it, but i am quite certain its less than what a complex animal such as a pig or a cow feels during its enslavement and at the moment it is forced to the butcher

i admire people who are able to only eat fruits and nuts as i would guess the amount of damage or pain happening there is less as the trees freely give the fruits and the nuts, they fall of the branches by themselves, no violence, no taking something away happening what is attached to a living being   


at times i think about a life in a tropical or subtropical climate where trees bear fruits the whole year and its so warm one could live naked and while enjoying ones walks in fruit tree gardens one could stretch out ones arm to catch a fruit at just that moment when the tree releases it  


in one of my most recent art projects of what i have published at [archive.org/details/preparativos](https://archive.org/details/preparativos) allready a first part of my text with 200 sketches contributed by a fellow artist ... i do describe such a setting of people living naked on an island growing their own food and researching evolutionairy pathways into a better future

&amp;#x200B;

beside ethical moral empathic dynamics there is one very important reason why i do hope that we human beings would stop enslaving animals

i wish for every human being to be able to grow its own vegan food, build its own natural home, grow hemp to use its stalks in the cooking and warming fire so that no trees get killed

at this moment in time, there is about 1700 m2 of fertile land used for agriculture available for every human being alive on the planet

a field study in sweden showed that 800 m2 of fertile land would be enough to grow vegan food for one person

adding to this 800 m2 of space used to grow ones own vegan food another 500 m2 or so to grow hemp so that one could use the inner parts of its stalks in the cooking and warming fire, build a home with, use the fibres what are the outer parts of the stalks to make clothes with and or as does the company [hempwood.com](https://hempwood.com), press them into  planks and panels what can be used to make floors, wall frames, roof beams, use the hemp seeds as highly nutritious food

i do believe that every human being alive would best have the choice wether to live alone or with others, wether to use machines or not, wether to work with and or for others, wether to build its own home or rent an appartement

as i understand it ... if more and more people would choose to stop consuming animal products more and more land could become available to cultivate plants

to me, personal individual sovereignity in a human being is best supported when the human being is able to ground itself on the land its home stands, built with its own hands from materials sourced sustainably most near,when the human being has built itself a cellar in the ground what is full of preserved foods canned by oneself lasting the whole winter and more, when the human being wears clothes woven or knit by hand from hemp fibres in front of the crackling fire in the oven during the cold winters days

wether a human being would want to live in such a near to the earth self sustaining way without hurting animals and without killing trees

on its own or together with family and or friends, in an intentional community structure

important is the choice, that every human being at all times would be able to cultivate its energy by choosing exactly when to connect why and how with a fellow living being",conspiracy,1

You aren't going to find data sets without opinions attached to them as scientific data is gathered under a hypothesis to justify gathering that data. Hypotheses are made to test a thesis, and a thesis is essentially an opinion that is either yet to be proven or an opinion of data sets that were gathered under another hypothesis.

All that said, data is data, you are free to take the data sets and form your own opinion about them. Make your own thesis, make hypotheses based off of your thesis, and research your hypotheses to see if additional testing confirms or contradicts that hypothesis. If that additional testing doesn't exist and you have a novel hypothesis, there are likely organizations out there to give you a grant to do those tests. If it's to confirm a facet of climate change that nobody considered prior, NASA, the government, and some other orgs dedicated to fighting climate change would likely be interested. If it's to contradict a facet of climate change and this hypothesis is again, novel, oil companies are hurting for any actual evidence which contradicts anthropogenic climate change, and they'd likely give you a grant if your hypothesis holds any water.",climatechange,1

Your “carbon footprint” is a total scam. 

It’s always been the companies and our political leaders that have ruined our world. Who woulda guessed, BP lobbied. 

“British Petroleum, the second largest non-state owned oil company in the world, with 18,700 gas and service stations worldwide, hired the public relations professionals Ogilvy &amp; Mather to promote the slant that climate change is not the fault of an oil giant, but that of individuals. It’s here that British Petroleum, or BP, first promoted and soon successfully popularized the term “carbon footprint” in the early aughts. The company unveiled its “carbon footprint calculator” in 2004 so one could assess how their normal daily life – going to work, buying food, and (gasp) traveling – is largely responsible for heating the globe.”",conspiracy,9

So, the data is prepared and the average for the baseline period established from that data. What is presented in graphs is the difference, or anomaly, from the baseline. 

After adjustment the HadCrut4 baseline is *lower* than the HadCrut3 baseline so anomalies appear to be greater. Because of the adjustment to HadCrut4 those 2 databases no longer align. As I mentioned earlier there were two adjustments. The first made little change such that the V3&amp;4 were still nearly identical. But now the HadCrut4 baseline period is lower, and all of the data is compared to that. 

We can no longer look at the HadCrut3 data on-line, but we can look at [HadCrut4](https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/temperature/HadCRUT4-gl.dat) and [HadCrut5](https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/temperature/HadCRUT5.0Analysis_gl.txt).

kb99nug,2023-11-29 13:18:31,"&gt;\- Explanations as to why man-made pathogens are not the most likely initial catalyst for what I've described (climate change, for example).

1 - Humans have been bombarded by pathogens for as long as life has existed. And every sort of it as well. So we have natural systems that combat pathogens, and one of the strongest of those is our genetic diversity. 

Chances are that any pathogen that is created will be less than 100% deadly. If its just 99.9% deadly, that means 1 in a 1000 people survive, resulting in 8 million survivors, more than enough to continue civilization, never mind humanity.

2 - There are different configurations that you need to get right to make a virus that can do max damage to people. You a pathogen to be highly infectious, without being very deadly. If it kills people too fast, we can quickly isolate where it is, where it came from and figure out how to stop people from moving around. Ebola is super deadly, but cant travel far because people isolate very fast. Covid was a ""good"" mix of deadly and infectious. You dont get sick for a very long time so its highly transmittable, but then it makes you sick afterwards. The problem is, if it kills too slowly we can start figuring out how to cure it, or start organising against it as we did in 2020. Covid was also not so deadly, that a lot of people did not take it seriously. If there was a 100% chance of death if infected, how many people would have argued over masks or lockdowns? Not many I bet.

I'm not going to even read the rest of the bullshit you wrote after my eyes dropped on this nugget of stupid above. 

Nearly all modern ocean going container ships are powered with diesel engines. Every single modern container ship is powered with a diesel engine. Actually several diesel engines: one or more prime movers (usually one), and several diesels to generate electrical power.  

Diesel engines that power container ships are usually fueled with bunker fuel, heavy fuel oil and in the case of LNG transport ships they also burn the ""boil off"" natural gas they are transporting. 

The container ships that don't run on diesel are generally 1970s era ships that use steam turbines and the boilers on those ships are fueled with... wait for it.. bunker oil. No matter, they all run on fossil fuels.

The guy refers to the French Revolution as happening in 1848, when in fact it was 50 years earlier than that. 

1871 was the Paris commune riots against napoleon. So I’m not sure what the photo he labels as barricades in 1848 was…the French do love a good riot/protest though. Could be Second World War stuff? 

A couple of the photos are modern, with a sepia filter over them. You can tell because of the resolution, as well as the clothes people are wearing and the wide angle of the lens.

The side by side shots of the Seine, which he says are ‘practically the same spot’ are actually hundreds of feet apart, you can tell by looking at the bridge and referring to the position of notre dame. Which means that everything in the foreground of the second image, which he says seems like a lot of work in 2 years, would be behind the camera in the first image.

1) In the US, lethal booby traps are generally illegal. If a company employed such devices, they would be found civilly and criminally liable for any injuries caused. 
2) Even if that wasn’t the case, safely maintaining lethal, explosive booby traps is expensive. If even one detonated accidentally or injured an innocent, the company would likely be forced to pay a much greater sum in damages than the cost of all the robberies it suffers in a year. Similarly, ink-smearing and other ‘scorched earth’ approaches cost a lot of money to implement and maintain. If one is set off inadvertently, you would ruin thousands of dollars worth of product/cash. 
3) Banks likely could not hire enough employees willing to wear a suicide vest to staff their retail locations. Even if they could, the amount you’d have to pay someone to bear that kind of risk would be astronomical. Cheaper to get robbed than have to find 10k employees who trust you to put a bomb vest on them.

The global 1% are ""super rich"" when compared to the world, where half of the world population still exists on the equivalent of $6.85/day ($2500/year) or less:

[https://blogs.worldbank.org/developmenttalk/half-global-population-lives-less-us685-person-day](https://blogs.worldbank.org/developmenttalk/half-global-population-lives-less-us685-person-day)

But it's far, far, *far* from being what the average American considers super rich:

*If you earn $60,000 a year after tax and you don’t have kids, you’re in the richest 1 percent of the world’s population.*

*If you have a household income of $130,000 after tax and you’ve got a partner and one kid, you’re also in the richest 1 percent.*

*Or say you have a household income of $160,000 after tax and you’ve got a partner and two kids. Guess what? You’re also in the 1 percent.*

kb92kst,2023-11-29 12:14:06,"Modelling the Earth's energy balance (ie the amount of solar radiation received vs the amount of radiation that leaves the upper atmosphere) can largely be modelled without consideration to the variations of the Earth's climate - the one exception is the Earth's albedo and how that changes over time.

&amp;nbsp;

With an El-Nino, where warmer ocean waters stay on the surface of the eastern Pacific - it doesn't directly change the overall energy balance of the Earth (indirectly it can lead to increase ice and snow melt, which would increase surface temperature). El-Nino is just about the transfer of head from oceans to atmosphere, and then during other years (esp La-Nina) more surface heat is transferred back into the oceans.

The modelling of the climate is far more complex, regional changes, changes in flooding, droughts etc. Though energy balance models are far simpler.",climatechange,1
